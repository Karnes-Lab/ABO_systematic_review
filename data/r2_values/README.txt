The software that will be used to calculate r2 and D' is 
NIH's LDpop: https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=ldpop

The task is to calculate and record r2 and D' betwen the functional and tagSNPs.

The tagSNPs are in the attached .csv files. 

We want to report the global r2 and D' as well as per population as seen in the drop-down menu on 
the NIH LDlpop tool under "Select Population".

The functional SNP for O include: rs8176719

The functional SNPs for B include: 
* rs7853989
* rs8176743
* rs8176746
* rs8176747
